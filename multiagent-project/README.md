# multiagent-project

Scaffold project integrating AutoGen, CrewAI and OpenAI Swarm concepts.

This scaffold contains simple, dependency-free stubs so you can run the
orchestration flow locally and replace the stubs with real framework
integrations later.

## How to use

1. Run `python multiagent_project_bootstrap.py` to create the project.
2. `cd multiagent-project` and run `python -m src.main` to execute the demo.
3. Edit `src/autogen_module`, `src/crewaimodule` and `src/swarm_module`
   to integrate the real frameworks.
